    <h2>An Enhanced Digital Fan Experience that Continually Evolves.</h2>
    <p>The Sacramento King's new sports and entertainment center, Golden 1 Center, was the first coliseum of the 21st century. Upon opening, it instantly became a high-tech haven for the NBA’s loudest fans and concert goers. The Kings needed to ensure the arena, app, and anything under the hood would remain ‘future-proof’ by delivering continuous innovation and upgrades to the overall experience for years to come.</p>

      <p>They needed a highly scalable platform to power their mobile app and to bring together multiple innovative services. They also needed the ability to continuously update the app and deliver new features like realtime stats, experience upgrades, in-seat food ordering, merchandise browsing and gamification. In addition, the app environment needed to facilitate the testing and deployment of yet-to-be-released features for upcoming seasons.</p>
      
     <p> However, connecting the world’s most technologically advanced arena and making it work effortlessly with a mobile app was a daunting task. Kings CTO Ryan Montoya decided to partner with Raw Engineering in preparation for this momentous event and to lay the foundation for what would become the most connected arena and most innovative app experience to date..</p>

      <h2 class="approach">Our Approach</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>A Solution Architecture Based on Business Goals</h3>
      <p>We first met with the Sacramento Kings + Golden 1 Center digital team to create a strategy specifically designed around their fans’ needs, the Sacramento Kings + Golden 1 Center business goals and technical requirements - including the need to be scalable and future-proof. It quickly became clear that building the App on Raw Engineering’s Digital Fan Experience Platform was the obvious solution. The platform supports a wide range of microservices that enable a fan to do things like buy tickets and parking, find seats, and order food. The app also supports realtime, in-arena gamification and an AI chatbot, called KAI, that provides in-app customer service, VIP notifications, a loyalty program, and the ability to report anything from a spill to feedback on the in-arena temperature.</p>

        <p>Perhaps, the most important feature of Raw Engineering’s Solution Architecture is the ability to quickly and easily add - or remove - microservices to support changes in the Sacramento Kings + Golden 1 Center fan needs and business goals.</p>
