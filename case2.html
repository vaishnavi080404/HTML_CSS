    <h2>A New Tech Stack, a New Brand, a New Design, and Not a Lot of Time.</h2>
    <p>As soon as Sylvie Shimizu started her new role as Webmaster at Elastic, she knew Elastic’s Web Stack needed an overhaul and that she needed a new partner. The existing platform was clumsy, slow and had a tendency to crash. There was no functional staging area and the production site ran on a completely different system. Furthermore, Elastic’s existing agency was slow to make necessary changes and their developers weren’t experienced enough to make the process run smoothly. Elastic had to wait anywhere from a few days to several weeks for changes, and were often told the features and integrations they wanted were impossible</p>

      <p>To add fuel to the fire, she was on a tight deadline to replace the Tech Stack, including the CMS, introduce a new brand and deliver a redesign that combined multiple website before Elastic’s first user conference in three months.</p>
      
      <p>Having worked with Raw Engineering previously, Sylvie new there was only one choice for a Technical Partner...Raw Engineering.</p>

      <h3>A Consultative Approach</h3>
      <p>Raw Engineering stepped up quickly to help Sylvie identify and address the pain points in Elastic’s current platform. We partnered with Sylvie to architect and implement a new nimble Tech Stack with a microservices-first approach, while concurrently developing the new website brand and design.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Contentstack Implementation</h3>
      <p>We analyzed how Elastic planned to use Contentstack - who would be editing content, how workflows would be approached, how content would be approved, etc. We also looked at Elastic’ content approach and environment requirements (dev, staging, production). Once we analyzed this data, we created the Content Architecture, Platform Architecture, Set up the User Management workflows, and set up Elastic’s AWS environment.</p>
