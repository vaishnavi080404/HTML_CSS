  <h2>
    An Innovative Fan Experience Strategy
  </h2>
  <p>Traditionally, sports teams viewed their Apps as compulsory sideshows to their primary business. However, the new, forward-thinking management team at the Miami HEAT/ American Airlines Arena was ready to set a new benchmark in the fan experience with an innovative mobile strategy. They redefined their App as a product - not a project to be disposed of and redone every few years.

    To realize this goal, Matthew Jafarian, EVP Business Strategy, knew he needed to partner with a company that had both a strong team and robust technology platform that would enable their mobile product to scale and iterate with their business needs. That is why the Miami HEAT chose to partner with Raw Engineering.
